zoneminder-scripts is a set of scripts for controlling the ZoneMinder surveillance software system.

It was mostly created in order to learn about managing github repositories, but the scripts may be useful to ZoneMinder users. I use them myself on a daily basis.

The Scripts
----

* **dosunrise** example script for using the sunrise script and 'at' to control ZoneMinder.

* **sunrise** print out the time of sunrise and sunset. Useful with the 'at' command.

* **zmctrl** read and write parameters to ZoneMinder monitors and zones.

* **zmgetimg** read images from ZoneMinder for a specified time period. Images can be viewed, saved or concatenated into a video.

* **zmgetvid** read video from ZoneMinder for a specified time period. All videos are concatenated into a single video.
